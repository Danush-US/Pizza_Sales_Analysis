## Introduction
In this project, I designed a dynamic dashboard customized to address a particular business issue. I used SQL to perform extensive cross-checking of the Tableau dashboard in order to guarantee accuracy and dependability. This project, which I've highlighted here, demonstrates my capacity to combine analytical abilities with visualization strategies to provide insightful information for data-driven decision-making.

  ## Dashboards
___
  ## Pizza Sales Dashboard
  Important business data, such as total revenue and average order value, are provided by this dashboard. It makes tracking hourly sales of pizza easier, provides insights into the sales distribution by pizza category and size, and tracks monthly trends of pizzas per order. Making decisions is improved by the division of pizzas by category.

 ## SQL Queries 

 I used SQL to thoughtfully cross-check the data that was included in the dashboard in order to make sure that the data was reliable and accurate. This systematic approach not only strengthens the integrity of the dashboard but also emphasizes a dedication to comprehensive validation using structured query language processes.
